# Text-Encryption-tool-using-python
This project leverages the "Caesar Cipher" technique to encrypt and decrypt messages, implemented using Python and Tkinter. The application provides an intuitive graphical interface for seamless interaction.

Key Features:

**Encrypt/Decrypt Messages**: Easily convert plaintext to ciphertext and vice versa using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
**Customizable Keys**: Use a customizable key to enhance the encryption process.
**User-Friendly Interface**: Developed with Tkinter for a clean, responsive, and easy-to-use GUI.
Explore the power of classical encryption techniques through a modern, interactive Python application.
